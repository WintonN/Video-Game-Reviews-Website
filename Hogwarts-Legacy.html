                        <p>
                            A game surrounded by controversy from the very beginning. While it is set in the one of the most well-known fantasy 
                            worlds, the game sadly falls short. The story offers an interesting premise and a unique stance in the world known 
                            to many, however it quickly falls off and becomes a long and tedious journey that has a largely predictable end.
                             The game lacks choice and consequences to players, leading to disappointing individual journeys. 
                             There are several tasks in the game that have no purpose and feel as though they have been solely created for 
                             the sake of adding playtime. The character relationships feels very forced, and the lack of choice or 
                             consequences leads to interesting story points. Overall, while this game had a lot of potential,
                              it led to a disappointing experience.

                            Hogwarts Legacy managed to catch a big break in relation to the music as it is branched off
                            of a story and told in the same universe as one of the largest franchises in modern history. From this, 
                            they were able to utilise a lot of the music to play at the nostalgia of fans and players. Although it 
                            does reuse some of the music, there are some new creative pieces that are still enjoyable to listen to.

                        <p>
                            The story in Hogwarts Legacy is utterly dissappointing and the player is left with a lot of 
                            unanswered questions. There are a lot of shortcuts taken, with some level design and boss 
                            fights practically being copied from other points in the game, a lackluster ending, and artificial
                            length by forcing the player to wait and complete side quests in between some story missions. The
                            most unforgivable and dissappointing part of the story is the illusion of choice given to the player
                            with no consequences no matter what they do.

                            The first couple of hours in Hogwarts Legacy, you get to experience the beautiful landscape
                            and play a part in a world you most likely dreamed of being part of. But once the novelty wares
                            off, you realise the world is big solely for the sake of it and forcing the player to travel long
                            distances and adding artificial game time. Hundreds of little quests that force you to explore every 
                            area of the map for no real reason, a world that feels completely empty with a lack of characters, it
                            all leads to a dissappointing experience.

                            The gameplay is the best part about Hogwarts Legacy because you get to play as a

                            getting stronger, the unique experience in playing in the world of Harry Potter makes it a
                            moderately enjoyable experience.
