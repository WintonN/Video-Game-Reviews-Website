                        <p>
                            Elden Ring is an incredibly beautiful experience. While the difficulty of the game might be a turnoff 
                            for some casual players, the world created around this game, the story of every character, and the 
                            incredible design are all worthy reasons to push through and take part in this game. The variety of 
                            weapons and combat styles allows players to enjoy the experience the way they desire. The world-building 
                            is absolutely incredible, feeling as though every character has a purpose in the world, every possible 
                            detail has been planned out and this world has truly existed for centuries. Overall, an incredible 
                            experience to partake in and one that I truly recommend.

                            The music in this incredible experience is truly masterful. Each piece of music correctly matches the 
                            theme of the area, the current position in the story, the emotional connections. The music from this 
                            game feels as though it was created by one of the greats for an incredible cinema experience. The music 
                            truly plays to your emotions and makes you feel as though you can battle the very gods of this world. 
                            The music in Elden Ring has raised the bar of the entire video game industry.

                        <p>
                            The story in Elden Ring is truly incredible. It shows that the incredible author George R.R. Martin 
                            worked on the masterful world building, and Hidetaka Miyazaki using his expert direction. The world 
                            in Elden Ring has been created in such a way that it truly feels as though it has existed for thousands 
                            of years. Every character, every town, every tree feels as though it has its own unique purpose. The 
                            game itself is worth playing purely for the story, it is truly an incredible experience.

                            The Elden Ring level design is masterful. The landscape is truly mesmerising, with secrets hidden in 
                            every nook and cranny. While the dungeons use similar themes and design elements, they are each layed 
                            out in a unique manner, leaving you to wonder whether you have truly fully explored any given dungeon. 
                            Althought the majority of the Elden Ring level design is spectacular, there is a lot of difficulty and 
                            frustration relating to cliffs in the game.

                            Elden Ring takes a different approach to the gameplay compared to most games. While most games sort of force 
                            you to adopt a certain playstyle, Elden Ring allows the player to adopt a multitude of playstyles, each with
                            their own variation. From fistfighting, to swordfighting, from sorcery with wands to prayer incantations with 
                            crosses, from two-handed swordfighting to dual wielding swords, the game allows the player to choose how they
                            want to play.
