                             major Action-Adventure franchises: Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, while also creating some smaller 
                             titles with loyal fan bases. While Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption are both open-world Action-Adventure
                              series, their other smaller titles, such as Max Payne or L.A. Noire, differ from this norm and prove that the 
                              company is able to create a games in a variety of different genres.

                            Bethesda Game Studios is an American video game developper established in 2001 as a spin-off to its publishing 
                            counterpart, Bethesda Softworks. Though it started small, the company quickly grew with the astounding success 
                            of the Elder Scrolls series. This success allowed the studios to purchase the rights to the Fallout series. 
                            These two video game series have become staples of Bethesda Game Studios and displaying the developers knack for
                            creating expansive Role Playing Games. More recently, in March 2021, Bethesda Game Studios was acquired by Microsoft 
                            to merge with Xbox Game Studios.
