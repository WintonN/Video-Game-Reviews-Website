                            Although the incredibly high difficulty and skill-ceiling might put off a lot of players initially, 
                            those who are able to push through witness a true masterpiece. Every enemy you encounter, every fight 
                            you partake in, every strike of your katana has you on the edge of your seat, with even the slightest 
                            hesitation leaving you in defeat. The punishing nature of the game makes your grueling victories even 
                            more rewarding. The game creates a complicated relationship with the player, but only once you have 
                            reached your breaking point will you be able to appreciate what this game truly has to offer and realise 
                            that this is truly an unforgettable experience.

                            The music in this incredible experience is truly masterful. Each piece of music correctly matches the 
                            theme of the area, the current position in the story, the emotional connections. The music from this 
                            game feels as though it was created by one of the greats for an incredible cinema experience. The music 
                            truly plays to your emotions and makes you feel as though you can battle the very gods of this world. 
                            The music in Sekiro has raised the bar of the entire video game industry.

                            The story, while sad, is beautiful in its telling. With multiple paths to follow and many secrets to 
                            uncover, it is left up to the player to piece together what has happened in thies new world and choose
                            how to proceed based what they uncorver. While it can be confusing at times, especially at the 
                            beginning of the game, it becomes easier to understand the longer you play and immerse yourself in 
                            the world.

                        <p>
                            The gameplay of Sekiro is incredibly difficult. Unlike most games where the difficulty slowly increases
                            as the story progresses and the player's skill and understanding of the game grows, Sekiro throws you
                            at the deep end, leaving you to struggle for a long time when you begin your journey. While it may feel
                            like banging your head against a brick wall, the feeling when it all clicks and you are able to take on
                            even the most challinging foes is a feeling of euphoria I likely will never forget.
