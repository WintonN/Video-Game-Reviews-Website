                        <p>
                            A moderately enjoyable game with an exciting premise. Being able to immerse yourself into 
                            the Star Wars Universe is truly a unique and exciting premise, though the game falls a bit 
                            short in that regard. The number of planets you visit is very limited, and the depth of the 
                            planet designs widely vary, with some only serving a purpose for a single story mission. 
                            Although the exploration of some of the larger planets is quite immersive and enjoyable, 
                            there is no need to explore other than achievement hunting and cosmetics. The story is 
                            quite an interesting one, but also becomes quite predictable towards the end. While there 
                            are interesting characters, there are very few that have an actual impact on the story. 
                            Overall, the game feels like a great foundation to a great franchise, but lacks depth as a 
                            standalone game.

                            Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order managed to catch a big break in relation to the music as it is branched off
                            of a story and told in the same universe as one of the largest franchises in modern history. From this, 
                            they were able to utilise a lot of the music to play at the nostalgia of fans and players. Although it 
                            does reuse some of the music, there are some new creative pieces that are still enjoyable to listen to.

                        <p>
                            Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has an interesting premise for a story. While it theoritically should be
                            a great story, however it tragically falls short. The game relies too heavily on the universe it is 
                            built on to do the heavy lifting and make you understand why the villains are bad and what is truly
                            at stake. Although it tries to dissipate this effect, it is still clearly there. The ending is also very 
                            lackluster and dissappointing, most likely for the purpose of creating a sequel.

                            A lot of the levels are really beautiful landscapes and truly beautiful scenery to behold, but once 
                            the novelty wares off and you begin exploring it's clear to see how the world was made. There are a
                            lot of areas that are big, just for the sake of being big. They hold no true story purpose, and very
                            little exploration value. You can play the game without discovering most of these areas, and there is
                            very little reason to go out of your way to discover them.

                            The gameplay is the best part about Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order because you get to play as a 
                            forceweilding Jedi! Although the combat style is very limitted and there isn't much benefit to 
                            getting stronger, the unique experience in playing in the world of Star Wars makes it an enjoyable 
                            experience. However, given this game has been clearly set up for a sequal, I would hope a lot of 
                            improvements are being made in it.
